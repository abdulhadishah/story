# 🗂️ Git, GitHub & Version Control: Learning Sandbox

This repo was created while learning Git and GitHub as part of my web development course. It isn’t a full project; instead, it was used as a small sandbox to practice real version-control workflows directly from the command line.

The files in this repo were intentionally created, modified, and committed while experimenting with Git, so I could understand how changes move through the working directory, staging area, and repository.

## ✨ Technologies

- `Git`
- `GitHub`
- `Command Line`

## 🚀 What I Practised Here

- Initialising a repo and creating commits
- Staging, unstaging, and tracking file changes
- Viewing logs, diffs, and commit history
- Creating and switching branches
- Merging changes and resolving simple cases
- Using `.gitignore` and cleanup commands
- Pushing to and working with a remote repo

Most files are short, single-line test files created to observe how Git reacts to edits, deletions, renamings, and commits.

## 📍 The Purpose

This repo wasn’t meant to store notes or build an app.

It was created so I could:

- learn version control by actually using it  
- make mistakes safely  
- experiment with commands until they make sense
